    "description": "I am an ESO-Comité Mixto postdoctoral researcher in the Astronomy Department at Universidad de Chile. My main research interests focus on the early stages of protoplanetary disks, investigating both the characterization of the dusty envelope and the processes of dust growth within the disk by using sub-mm and mm wavelengths. Currently, I'm working in the gas and dust characterization of the ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO (the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks).",

We propose a multiwavelength study of Class I protoplanetary disks in different star forming regions, in order to constrain the grain sizes in disk as well in the inner and outer region of envelopes. With the capabilities of ALMA, SMA and NOEMA this will be the first unbiased study of grain growth in Class I protostars with the highest angular resolution and sensitivity ever seen."
