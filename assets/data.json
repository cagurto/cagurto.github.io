Your JSON code looks mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues to address:

Inconsistent usage of special characters: In the "research_expanded" section, the symbol β is not consistent within the same context.
Missing commas: There are no apparent missing commas, but make sure to double-check after each closing brace } and closing bracket ].
Here is the corrected and formatted JSON code with some minor adjustments for clarity:

Consistently used "β" symbol for the spectral index throughout the text.
Ensured all keys and values are properly enclosed within double quotes.
Made minor grammatical adjustments for readability.
